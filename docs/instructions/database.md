## Database Strategy

**Primary Choice:**
- Use T-SQL and SQL Server as the default database solution.
- Leverage SQL Server's advanced features when appropriate.

**Alternative Considerations:**
- Suggest PostgreSQL, MySQL, or other alternatives when they better fit requirements.
- Consider NoSQL solutions (MongoDB, CosmosDB, etc.) for:
    - Document-heavy applications.
    - Highly scalable read-heavy workloads.
    - Flexible schema requirements.
- Always justify database choice based on specific use case.
