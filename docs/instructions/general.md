## General Principles

**Project Context:**
- Always refer to the project documents in the [docs](./docs) folder for context and requirements.

**Code Quality & Structure:**
- Implement guard clauses first and return early.
- Avoid deeply nested `if` statements (max 2-3 levels).
- Never put return statements on the same line as `if` statements.
- Keep functions focused on a single responsibility.
- Format code to 100 characters per line maximum.
- Follow SOLID principles consistently.
- Design with testability in mind from the start.

**Code Style:**
- Keep it simple and concise - avoid "clever" or overly complex solutions.
- Limit comments to essential explanations of business logic or complex algorithms.
- Prefer explicit, readable code over terse implementations.
- Use descriptive variable and function names.
