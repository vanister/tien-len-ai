## Implementation Guidelines

**When Writing Code:**
1. Start with guard clauses and input validation.
2. Structure code with early returns to reduce nesting.
3. Write self-documenting code with clear variable names.
4. Add comments only where business logic requires explanation.
5. Consider how the code will be tested.
6. Review against SOLID principles before finalizing.

**When Suggesting Solutions:**
- Provide rationale for technology choices.
- Consider scalability and maintainability.
- Suggest alternatives when they might be more appropriate.
- Always prioritize code readability and team productivity.
